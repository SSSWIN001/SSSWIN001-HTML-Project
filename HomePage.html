        <h2>Common Computer Threats:</h2>
    <h3><dt>Virus</dt></h3>
<p><dd>A <em>virus</em> attaches itself to a program or file that is then spread from one computer to another, leaving a copy of itself as it travels. Viruses can cause various degrees of damage; they are executable programs that alter the data on a computer and can corrupt the data to such an extent that the data becomes unusable.</dd></p>
    <h3><dt>Worm</dt></h3> 
<p><dd>A <em>worm</em> uses file or information transport features on the resident system to travel. Worms also have the ability to replicate themselves so the computer may not send out a single worm, it could send out an unlimited number, causing a devastating effect. If a worm got into your email address book. It could send a copy of itself to everyone listed there and then repeat the same in each of
the recipient's email address books. Because worms replicate so readily, they tend to consume large amounts of system memory or network bandwidth, resulting in servers that function too slowly to provide effective network resources. </dd></p>
    <h3><dt>Trojan Horse</dt></h3>
    <p><dd>A <em>trojan horse</em>, by its name, is designed to appear to be valid &amp; useful software, but will do damage once installed and run on a computer. A Trojan exhibits varying results and damage on a computer, ranging from changing a desktop and tampering with the icons to causing serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on the system. Trojans can also create a <i>backdoor</i> on a computer that provides unauthorised users access to your system, possibly allowing confidential or personal information to be compromised. Trojans don't behave like
viruses and worms as they don't reproduce or replicate. </dd></p>
